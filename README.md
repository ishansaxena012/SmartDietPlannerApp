## How It Works
1. Users input personal details (age, gender, health conditions, dietary preferences, etc.).
2. The system calculates **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**.
3. The KNN algorithm recommends meals matching user requirements.
4. Users receive **optimized, culturally appropriate** meal plans.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-time meal tracking and updates**
- **Integration with fitness apps and wearables**
- **Cloud-based database for scalability**
- **Cross-platform availability (iOS & Web)**
